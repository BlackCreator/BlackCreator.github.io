I investigated numerical schemes based on finite element approximation for solving heat and mass transfer problems in 3D domains with internal moving
boundaries and inclusions. I developed, implemented, and verified a numerical scheme based on the multiscale discontinuous Galerkin method on various types
of meshes including tetrahedral meshes with hierarchical basis using both continuous and discontinuous elements. 
I have successfully defended my master thesis on the design of the effective models for Gas-Hydrate problems in heterogeneous medium on different scales
using numerical homogenization.
