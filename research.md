Currently, I'm doing a PhD on uncertainty quantification. I'm working on the multi-index and multi-level Markov chain Monte Carlo methods combined with the discontinuous Galerkin method.

During the masters and undergraduate studies, I investigated numerical schemes based on the finite element approximation for solving the heat and mass transfer problems in 3D domains with internal moving
boundaries and inclusions.
I developed, implemented in C++, and verified a numerical scheme based on the multiscale discontinuous Galerkin method on various types of meshes including tetrahedral meshes with hierarchical basis using both continuous and discontinuous elements. 
I have successfully defended my master thesis on the design of the effective models for Gas-Hydrate problems in heterogeneous medium with different scales using numerical homogenization.
