Greetings. My real name is Stanislav Polishchuk. Currently, I’m a Master of Science in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. My research fields include numerical analysis and scientific computing, especially finite element analysis (nonconforming), multilevel solvers, Stefan problems (phase transition), and inverse problems. The blog is intended for the broader audience including students, engineers, applied scientists, and for those who are interested in scientific computing and applied mathematics. It combines practical aspects, numerical results, and analysis of numerical methods. For many shown methods it provides the source code with set-up instructions. If you have any questions, please feel free to send me a message to exsidia@gmail.com. Thanks for your attention.

Also, here’s my [Curriculum Vitae]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/cv-us.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
